# Rhythmic
An open source rhythm game with the intent to mimic games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but includes the ability to play custom songs.

Currently, it is in a playable state but quite can be buggy

## Setup
Currently, the game will only compile on windows
* Clone the repo
* Open with Visual Studio 2022
* Download GLFW and GLM
* Point `GLFW_ROOT_DIR` and `GLM_ROOT_DIR` to where you extracted the files
* Compile
* Set debug options for rhythmic.exe
* Add argument "-dd=pathToGameDirectory"

A video on how to set up will be on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xX3cy16zFZrJnofXRm_3A)
